Aerodynamic Shape Optimization using CFD
What it is: A tool that simulates and optimizes airfoil or fuselage shapes using computational fluid dynamics (CFD), potentially using open-source solvers like OpenFOAM or SU2.

Skills it shows: CFD, optimization algorithms, numerical PDEs, Python/C++, engineering simulation.

Cool extras:

Implement genetic algorithms or gradient descent for optimization.

Use Paraview or Matplotlib for visualizations.

Bonus if you integrate machine learning for surrogate modeling.






ðŸ›° 3. Satellite Attitude Control System (ACS) Simulator
What it is: Simulate the dynamics and control of a satellite's attitude using quaternions, Euler angles, and PID/LQR controllers.

Skills it shows: Rigid body dynamics, control systems, MATLAB/Simulink or Python, applied physics.

Cool extras:

Include reaction wheels, magnetorquers, and momentum dumping.

Add visualization with 3D graphics (e.g., vpython, blender, three.js).






ðŸŒŒ 4. Kalman Filter for Sensor Fusion in Aerospace Systems
What it is: A project that fuses data from simulated IMUs, GPS, and other sensors using an Extended or Unscented Kalman Filter to track position and velocity.

Skills it shows: Estimation theory, linear algebra, stochastic processes, aerospace navigation.

Cool extras:

Make a Jupyter Notebook demo.

Use real drone or satellite telemetry data for testing.

Animate the filtered vs raw state estimates.








ðŸ”¬ 5. Materials for Space: Radiation Shielding Simulation
What it is: Simulate how different materials attenuate space radiation (cosmic rays, solar flares), possibly using Monte Carlo methods or simplified GEANT4-like simulations.

Skills it shows: Computational physics, radiation modeling, data analysis, Monte Carlo methods.

Cool extras:

Use NASA or ESA datasets to validate models.

Compare materials (polyethylene vs aluminum vs water).

Provide a report or GUI summarizing results interactively.
